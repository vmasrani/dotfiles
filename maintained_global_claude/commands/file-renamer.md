Rename this file into 'Author Name - Title - Subtitle' format.

If there's not enough information in the text, return the original filename or a cleaned-up version of it. If the file is already in Author Name - Title - Subtitle format, simply return the original filename

Return ONLY the new filename with no extension, NO OTHER COMMENTARY.

Examples of correct output:
1. 'J.K. Rowling - Harry Potter - The Philosopher's Stone'
2. 'George Orwell - 1984'
3. 'Isaac Asimov - Foundation'

Example of incorrect output:

 - "Based on the filename "Robert P. George - Natural ...."
 - "I'm sorry, I can't rename the file because I don't have enough information to determine the author and title."
