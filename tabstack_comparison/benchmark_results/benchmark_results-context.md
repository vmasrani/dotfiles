# benchmark_results

_Last updated: 2026-01-27_

## Purpose
Directory structure for storing and organizing benchmark comparison results between different models (GPT-4.1 and TabStack) used in the tabstack_comparison project.

## Subdirectories
| Directory | Purpose | Has Context File |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| gpt41 | Benchmark results for GPT-4.1 model runs | yes |
| tabstack | Benchmark results for TabStack model runs | yes |

## Notes
- Currently contains placeholder context files for subdirectories
- Appears to be a data collection structure awaiting benchmark result files (CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Each subdirectory would typically contain performance metrics, timing data, and comparison results
